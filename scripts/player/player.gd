class_name Player
extends CharacterBody3D
## The first-person player. One scene, instantiated once per player - a local
## player in the playtest now, up to six copies in a 3v3 match later.
##
## [b]Where the seams are, on purpose.[/b]
##
## - [b]All movement is inside this node.[/b] Nothing asks GameManager to move
##   anyone, and there is no "the player" singleton. Every other player in the
##   match will be another instance of this same scene.
## - [b]Input is optional, not assumed.[/b] [member input_enabled] is the single
##   switch between "this player listens to the keyboard" and "this player's
##   transform is set by the network". A remote player is the same scene with
##   input off, so Chapter 4 adds replication without a second controller.
## - [b]Identity is data, not node state.[/b] [member state] is a Chapter 1
##   [PlayerState], so health and team already have somewhere to live without
##   this script growing fields for them.
##
## [b]Node layout and why:[/b]
## [codeblock]
## Player (CharacterBody3D)   - yaw only, never pitched
##  |- Collision              - capsule, resized for crouch
##  |- Head (Node3D)          - pitch pivot, sits at eye height
##      |- Camera3D           - the only thing that should ever be "current"
## [/codeblock]
## Yaw lives on the body and pitch on the head so that movement is always
## computed from a level heading. If the body were pitched, walking downhill
## would steer you into the ground.

# --- Signals ------------------------------------------------------------

## Health changed, or the player died. [param alive] is false on the frame
## health reaches zero. The HUD reads this; Chapter 5's scoreboard will too.
signal health_changed(health: int, alive: bool)

## A shot this player fired has been resolved by whoever is authoritative for
## it. [param victim] is the [Player] that was hit, or null for scenery, and
## [param at] / [param normal] describe where the round stopped. [param is_local]
## is false when this arrived over the network, which is how the shooter - and
## its weapon feedback - tell its own confirmed hit apart from a verdict about
## somebody else's.
signal shot_resolved(at: Vector3, normal: Vector3, victim: Player, zone: int, killed: bool, is_local: bool)

## A shot landed on this player. Fired on every machine, including the victim's
## own, so a HUD hit indicator is one connection rather than a special case for
## "am I the one who got shot".
signal took_hit(from: Node, amount: float, zone: int)

## The player was eliminated. [param source] is whatever did it, which may be
## null - falling out of the world should still produce a death.
signal died(source: Node)

## Emitted when a weapon is equipped or removed. The HUD re-reads ammo on this
## rather than polling.
signal weapon_changed(weapon: Weapon)

## A reload started or finished. [param duration] is the full reload time when
## one started and zero when one finished. Separate from the weapon's own signal
## so the HUD does not have to hold a reference to the weapon to know.
signal reloading_changed(reloading: bool, duration: float)

## The trigger was pulled on an empty magazine.
signal dry_fired

# --- Body dimensions ---------------------------------------------------
# Metres. The capsule's origin is at the player's feet, so a shape of height h
# sits with its centre at y = h / 2.

@export var stand_height: float = 1.8

## Collision height while crouched. Must stay above 2x [member body_radius] or
## Godot will not accept it as a capsule.
@export var crouch_height: float = 1.1

@export var body_radius: float = 0.35

# --- Speeds ------------------------------------------------------------
# Deliberately not copied from any existing game. These are tuned to feel
# deliberate rather than floaty: enough acceleration to stop instantly on a
# dime, not so much that the player skates.

## Air control, as a fraction of [member ground_acceleration]. Low on purpose:
## a tactical shooter should reward committing to a jump rather than let the
## player steer freely in mid-air.

## Horizontal speed lost per second while airborne with no input. Also low, so
## a jump keeps its momentum.

## Downward acceleration. Higher than Earth's 9.8 so jumps feel snappy and
## falls resolve quickly.

## Upward speed applied by a jump. With the default gravity this clears about
## 0.84 m, which is enough to get onto a waist-high crate and not much else.

## Downward speed cap, so a long fall does not turn into tunnelling.
@export var terminal_fall_speed: float = 40.0

## Grace period after walking off a ledge during which a jump still works.
## Without it, walking down a slope can drop the floor for a frame and eat the
## jump. Set to 0 to disable.

## How far the body may snap downwards to stay in contact with a slope is
## [member CharacterBody3D.floor_snap_length], set on the node in
## [code]player.tscn[/code]. It is deliberately not declared here: a script
## variable of that name shadows the engine's own property, so the number
## would appear in the Inspector looking configurable while the real value
## stayed at the engine default and the controller quietly failed to follow
## slopes down.

## Tallest ledge the player walks up without jumping, in metres. Uses a real
## overlap test rather than a raycast, so it cannot lift the player into a
## ceiling.
@export var step_height: float = 0.4

## Clearance required around the lifted position before a step is taken.
## Without it the lifted capsule can pass a ledge corner by a millimetre and
## then snag on it, which reads as the player stuttering against the stair.
const STEP_CLEARANCE := 0.02

# --- Camera ------------------------------------------------------------

@export_group("Camera")
## Multiplier turning the 0..1 setting in GameConfig into radians per pixel of
## mouse movement. A raw sensitivity number is meaningless without it, so the
## two are kept apart: the player owns this, the player-facing option does not.
@export var sensitivity_scale: float = 0.003

## How far up or down the head can look, in degrees. Just under 90 so the view
## can reach straight up and down without ever passing through the poles and
## flipping, which is the classic way an FPS camera breaks.

## interpolates between them rather than snapping, so crouching does not jolt.

# --- Network identity (Chapter 4) ----------------------------------------

## Which peer drives this body. Defaults to [constant NetworkManager.SERVER_PEER_ID]

## the only one in the world.
@export var peer_id: int = NetworkManager.SERVER_PEER_ID

## How many shots this body's authority has refused, and why the most recent
## one was refused.
##
## Public because a silently dropped shot is the hardest kind of networking bug
## to diagnose: from the shooter's side the trigger worked, the flash played,

## is wrong with combat" into "peer 4 has had nine rejected shots", which points
## straight at the cause.

# --- Replicated state ----------------------------------------------------

## Health as the network sees it.
##
## [b]This is a mirror of [member PlayerState.health], not a replacement for
## it.[/b] The value lives on this node so it can cross the wire, and the job
## of putting it back into [member state] on a receiving machine belongs to the
## host's state RPC ([method _net_state_receive] and its helper [method
## _sync_state_from_network]). Keeping both is deliberate rather than
## duplicated: `state` is the game object's truth and is what the HUD, the
## scoreboard and the Chapter 5 round loop read, while these three exist only
## to cross the wire.
var net_health: int = PlayerState.MAX_HEALTH
var net_alive: bool = true
var net_team: int = Team.Side.NONE

## Whether the host has ever sent this body's state.
##
## The three fields above all have defaults, and two of them -
## [constant PlayerState.MAX_HEALTH] and [code]true[/code] - are exactly what
## the host would send for an untouched player. So their defaults cannot be
## read as an answer. [member net_team] can: [constant Team.Side.NONE] is a
## value the host never sends, because every player is given a side before it is
## spawned. This flag turns that into an explicit "the host has spoken" rather
## than leaving it implicit in a magic constant - see
## [method _sync_state_from_network] for what goes wrong without it.
var _net_state_received: bool = false

# --- Interpolation (remote bodies only) -----------------------------------

## Where a remote body was last told to be, and where it is allowed to be
## drawn while it catches up.
##
## The obvious implementation - let the synchroniser write
## [member Node3D.global_position] and draw it - produces visible 20 Hz
## stepping, because a body jumps a third of a metre every 50 ms and then sits
## still. Snapping the draw position toward the replicated one at a bounded rate
## trades a few milliseconds of latency for motion that reads as continuous,

##
## Named for the unit it is in, because [member
## MultiplayerSynchronizer.replication_interval] is a duration and not a rate,

## - producing a twenty-second interval and a replication system that appears to
## work on a body standing still.
const TRANSFORM_REPLICATION_SECONDS := 0.05

## How far a client's claimed eye position may be from where the host believes
## that player is, in metres, before the shot is refused.
##
## Sized for the worst honest case rather than the average one. The host's copy
## of a remote body is a snapshot behind, and a player at a sprint covers
## several metres in 50 ms, so a tight bound would reject legitimate shots
## during exactly the movement a player is most likely to be shooting during.
## Two metres is comfortably more than interpolation lag and comfortably less
## than "somewhere else entirely".
const MAX_SHOT_ORIGIN_ERROR := 2.0

## Slack allowed on the host's fire-rate check, in milliseconds. The client
## enforces the real interval against its own clock and the host enforces the
## same interval against a different one, so without a little tolerance a
## legitimate shot gets refused roughly whenever the two clocks disagree.
