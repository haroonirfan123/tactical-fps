## A deliberately stupid hostile that shoots at the player, so Chapter 3's
## combat loop runs both ways.
##
## [b]Why this exists at all.[/b] The chapter's own brief asks for a player who
## can take damage and can die, but the test range it also asks for is entirely
## static - dummies and a wall. Nothing in that range can answer back, so "the
## player can die" would be a claim about a code path nothing exercises. This
## is the cheapest thing that makes the claim true.
##
## [b]Why it is so simple.[/b] It has no behaviour tree, no cover logic, no
## accuracy model and no memory of the player. It finds the nearest living
## player, turns towards them, and fires when it is pointing at them. That is
## the entire algorithm, and it is the whole of the AI budget for Chapter 3 -
## Chapter 6 is where enemy behaviour is designed.
##
## [b]It damages the player through [Damageable], not by writing to
## [member PlayerState].[/b] That is the part worth keeping. The turret and the
## player's own weapon are two completely unrelated damage sources, and they go
## through exactly the same one method, so a bug in the damage path shows up
## whichever one you test with first.
##
## Disposable with the rest of the grey box.

## Damage per shot. Low enough that standing in the open does not end the test
## run in two seconds.
@export var damage_per_shot: float = 9.0

## Seconds between shots. Deliberately slow: the point is that the player can be
## hurt, not that standing still is fatal.

## How far it will engage. Beyond this the turret does not even turn.
@export var engagement_range: float = 32.0

## Seconds before the very first shot, so a player who spawns next to the turret
## gets a moment to find it.
@export var start_delay: float = 3.0

## How quickly the barrel swings onto the target, in radians per second. Slow
## enough that a player can watch it turn and understand it is aiming at them.
@export var turn_speed: float = 2.6

## How far off target the turret may be and still fire, in degrees. Loose
## enough not to need frame-perfect tracking, tight enough that hiding behind
## cover works.

## Whether a wall between the turret and the player blocks the shot. On, because
## a turret that shoots through the cover the chapter also asks for would be
## testing nothing.

## Whether the turret shoots at all. The test harness turns this off to measure
## the player in isolation, and back on to prove it can be hurt.
