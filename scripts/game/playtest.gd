extends Node3D
## The screen shown while there is no real match to get into: the grey box with
## the players in it.
##
## [b]This is a development harness, not a final level and not a final match.[/b]
## Chapter 7 replaces the environment and Chapter 8 replaces the presentation.
## Everything that actually has to survive both - the [Player] scene, the
## [NetworkManager] autoload, the weapon and its damage contract - lives outside
## this file and is untouched by either.
##
## ## Why it handles both offline and online
##
## There are two ways to arrive at this scene, and they end in the same place:
##
## - [b]Offline.[/b] Nobody pressed Host or Join. One local player is
##   instantiated directly, on the spot, with no network involved. This is what
##   the single-player playtest has always been, and Chapter 3's whole test
##   suite runs through it.
## - [b]Online.[/b] Somebody pressed Host or Join. The [MultiplayerSpawner] owns
##   every body from then on, on every machine, and this node's only job is to
##   decide [b]where[/b] a body appears and ask the host to spawn it.
##
## Keeping both in one scene rather than adding a separate "network match" scene
## means there is one place where a player is created, so there is one place to
## be wrong. A second scene would be a second spawner, a second camera handoff,
## and a second copy of the rule that a body is configured on every machine and
## not just the one that owns it.
##
## ## The rule that is easy to get wrong
##
## A spawned player's [method Player.configure_for_network] is called on
## [b]every[/b] machine, with the same arguments, not only on the one that owns
## it. That is what makes the authority flags agree across the session. A
## client that skipped configuration would have a body whose synchronisers
## pointed at nobody, and the failure would be "replication silently does
## nothing" rather than anything that points at the cause.

const PLAYER_SCENE := preload("res://scenes/player/player.tscn")

## Where spawned bodies are parented, relative to the spawner.
##
## A named constant rather than a literal in the scene file, because the path
## has to agree with the node that actually exists and the scene file is not
## somewhere a reader would think to look for that. See
## [method _configure_spawner] for the check that keeps the two in step.
