## [b]MAIN_MENU[/b] - the title screen. Nothing is loaded and nobody is
## connected yet.
##
## The menu screen itself lives in [code]res://scenes/ui/[/code] and is driven
## by whoever boots the game; this state only decides what "being in the menu"
## means. Keeping it empty is honest - there is genuinely nothing to tear down
## here yet, and Chapter 8 will add it when there is a menu to manage.

## Leaves the menu and opens the lobby. The menu screen calls this.
## Hosting and joining happen through [NetworkManager] before or after this,
## never from in here.
