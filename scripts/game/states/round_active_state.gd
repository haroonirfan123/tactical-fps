## [b]ROUND_ACTIVE[/b] - live combat.
##
## There is no combat system yet, so this state does the two things that are
## genuinely its job and no one else's: it owns the round clock, and it is the
## single place a round is allowed to end.
##
## Note that [method end_round] does not award the win. It records who won and
## hands over to [b]ROUND_END[/b], which resolves the round in one place.
## That means the score, the [signal EventBus.round_ended] event and the
## next-phase decision all happen together and cannot drift apart.

## Emitted every frame with the seconds left in the round.
