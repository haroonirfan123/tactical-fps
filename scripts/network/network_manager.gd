extends Node
## Owns the multiplayer peer and all connection state. Registered as the
## [code]NetworkManager[/code] autoload.
##
## Everything netcode-related goes through here, and nothing else in the game
## touches [ENetMultiplayerPeer] directly. Two reasons: the rest of the game
## can then ask simple questions ("am I the host?", "who is connected?")
## without caring about ENet, and there is exactly one place to look when
## connections misbehave.
##
## ## Authority
##
## Chapter 4 put the authority rules here, in one place, because scattering
## them across the player and the match scene is how two peers end up both
## thinking they own a body:
##
## - **A client owns its own movement.** Its [Player] runs the full Chapter 2
##   physics locally and replicates its transform. The host does not simulate
##   remote players and does not need to - it receives their snapshots and
##   applies them.
## - **The host owns health, team and death.** Those live on a second
##   synchroniser whose authority is always [constant SERVER_PEER_ID], so no
##   amount of client enthusiasm can write them.
## - **The host resolves every shot.** A client sends an aim ray; the host
##   re-derives the ray from its own copy of the world and decides what was hit.
##   The client is told what happened so it can draw it.
##
## The one asymmetry worth naming: the host's own player is both authoritative
## for its transform [b]and[/b] a remote body to nobody, so it takes the
## validating path locally without an RPC round trip.

# --- Signals ------------------------------------------------------------

## This machine started a server.

## We are now connected to a server as a client.
signal join_succeeded

## Joining failed. [param reason] is safe to show in the UI.

## A peer connected. [param peer_id] is 0 for the host itself on a client.
signal peer_connected(peer_id: int)

## A peer disconnected.
signal peer_disconnected(peer_id: int)

## We lost the server we were connected to.
signal server_disconnected

## The roster changed: somebody joined, left, or changed health. The dev UI
## listens to this rather than polling.
signal roster_updated

## Host only. A peer has been given a side and should now be spawned.
## [param player_name] is what the scoreboard will show.
signal peer_registered(peer_id: int, team_side: int, player_name: String)

## Host only. A peer is gone and their body should be removed from every
## machine. Raised before the node is freed so listeners can still look it up.
signal peer_unregistered(peer_id: int)

## A client has finished loading its match scene and is ready to be given a
## body. Host only, and raised by [method request_spawn].
