class_name Weapon
extends Node3D
## One equipped weapon: its magazine, its trigger, its reload timer and the
## hitscan that turns a trigger pull into a line in the world.
##
## [b]What this owns versus what the player owns.[/b] The split is deliberate
## and it is the whole reason this is a separate node:
##
## - [b]The weapon owns[/b] when a shot happens, how much damage it does, what
##   it hits, recoil magnitude, magazine contents and reload progress.
## - [b]The player owns[/b] the camera, the aim direction, the input state and
##   the health that receives the damage. The player polls the trigger and
##   passes the aim ray in; it never decides whether a shot is legal.
##
## So [Player] contains no fire-rate maths, no magazine arithmetic and no
## knowledge of [member WeaponData], and this file contains no input polling and
## no reference to a camera. Chapter 3's brief asks for exactly that separation,
## and Chapter 4 needs it for a second reason: when the host has to validate a
## client's shot, it needs the origin and direction as two values it can be
## handed and re-run, not a ray buried inside a camera.
##
## [b]Why aim is passed in rather than read from a camera here.[/b] The ray
## starts at the camera, not the muzzle, so the crosshair tells the truth about
## where the bullet goes. The muzzle is only where the flash and the tracer
## start, which is why a shot can look like it comes from the barrel and still
## land exactly under the crosshair.
##
## [b]Not included, by design.[/b] No view bob, no ADS, no animation, no
## projectile path. [b]Not a singleton[/b] and not a global - it is a child of
## the player that owns it, so six players in a match means six of these.

# --- Configuration ------------------------------------------------------

## The stats. Assigned by [method equip] from the player's loadout; never
## written at runtime, because [method load] hands every player the same shared
## instance.
var data: WeaponData = null

## The body whose shots this weapon must not hit. Set by [method equip] so the
## raycast can exclude the shooter without this class needing to know what a
## Player is.
var shooter: CollisionObject3D = null

# --- Signals ------------------------------------------------------------
# Emitted rather than called directly on the player, so the weapon has no
# compile-time dependency on the player and Chapter 4 can drive the same
# signals from a replicated shot.

## A round left the barrel. Carries no hit information, because at the moment it
## is emitted nothing has been hit yet.
##
## The player listens and calls [method hitscan] with its own aim ray. That
## indirection is the point: this class has no camera and therefore no opinion
## about where the player is looking, and in Chapter 4 the host can call
## [method hitscan] itself with a client's ray without going anywhere near a
## camera.
signal fired

## The shot connected. [param killed] lets the hit marker change on a kill.
signal hit_confirmed(killed: bool, zone: int, health_left: int)

## A bullet landed somewhere and asked for an impact effect.
##
## [b]Deliberately a request, not a spawn.[/b] The weapon decides that a shot
## ended at a point; it does not know or care what that looks like. A local
## presentation node listens and draws it. That split is what keeps Chapter 4
## honest: the replicated shot is a gameplay fact, and the spark is something
## the machine that pressed the trigger draws locally, so the host validating
## someone else's shot cannot end up drawing sparks in front of the shooter.
signal impact_requested(position: Vector3, normal: Vector3, zone: int)

## The trigger was pulled with an empty magazine. Drives the dry-fire click.
signal dry_fired

## Reloading started. [param duration] is the full reload time.
signal reload_started(duration: float)

## Reloading finished, whether or not it was interrupted.
signal reload_finished

## Magazine contents changed, for the HUD and the debug overlay.
signal ammo_changed(magazine: int, reserve: int)

## Ask the player to kick the camera. Degrees, positive is upward.
signal recoil_requested(pitch_degrees: float, yaw_degrees: float)

# --- Ammunition ---------------------------------------------------------

## Rounds left in the magazine. The only ammunition number that changes by
## firing.
var ammo_in_magazine: int = 0

## Reserve ammunition. [b]Infinite in practice for now[/b], by design: players
## re-buy at the start of every round, so a per-match pool is a number nothing
## would ever consult. The field exists anyway because Chapter 5's buy system
## and any later limited-ammo mode both need the slot to be there, and adding
## it then would mean reshaping this API.
var reserve_ammo: int = 0

## When true, [method try_reload] always succeeds and never decrements
## [member reserve_ammo]. Set it false and the weapon draws down a real finite
## pool, with no other code changing.
var infinite_reserve: bool = true

## How many magazines' worth of rounds [member reserve_ammo] starts at when
## infinite reserve is off. Purely a starting figure for a mode that does not
## exist yet.

## Rounds left to fire in the current burst, for [constant WeaponData.FireMode.BURST].
var _burst_left: int = 0

## Seconds until the next round of a burst, which fires at the weapon's own
## interval rather than at the frame rate.

## [b]Deliberately not gated on the burst counter.[/b] [method update_trigger]

## started is in the middle of firing by definition. Folding that same

## answer was always no - the counter had just been set to the burst size - so
