## Everything about a shot that is only worth showing to the machine that pulled
## the trigger.
##
## [b]This node is the network boundary for weapon presentation.[/b] The weapon
## knows where a round stopped; it emits that as [signal Weapon.impact_requested]
## and stops there. This listens and decides to draw. In Chapter 4, when a
## client's shot is validated by the host, the host re-runs the hitscan and gets
## a position back - and the machine that draws the spark is still the one whose
## input caused it, not the one that happened to be authoritative. Keeping the
## two apart is why the two classes are separate, and it means a future
## "spectator mode shows other players' tracers" feature has somewhere to live
## without either class growing a flag it should not have.
##
## [b]Muzzle flash and tracer are not here yet[/b] and do not need to be: the
## flash is a light on the weapon, driven by the local trigger, and the tracer
## would be spawned the same way as an impact. Chapter 8 replaces this file.

## The effect spawned where a round stops.
@export var impact_scene: PackedScene

## Rejects impacts from further away than this. A round that travelled the
## weapon's whole 45 m range is a legitimate hit and should be marked; this is
## only here so a bad origin from a network message cannot fill the screen with
## effects.

## Impacts alive at once. A full automatic burst is seven or eight rounds a

## never reached in normal play - it exists so a pathological frame cannot
