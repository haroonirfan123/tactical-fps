## Boot scene. Set as the project's main scene, so this is the first thing
## that runs, and it is never freed for the rest of the session.
##
## Its only job is routing: listen to [GameManager] and put the screen that
## belongs to the current phase under [member %ScreenHost]. It owns no game
## state of its own.
##
## [b]Why this scene never changes:[/b] routing has to outlive whatever it is
## routing to. If the router swapped itself out with the menu scene, there
## would be nothing left to handle the phase change that took the player out
## of the menu, and the game would need a second router. So the screens come
## and go as children of this node, which stays put.
##
## Nothing in this file is temporary. The grey box is a separate scene, and the
## debug overlay is a separate scene behind [constant DEV_OVERLAY_ENABLED], so
## both can be deleted for a release without touching the router.

## Set false to drop the debug overlay from a build, or delete
## [code]scenes/ui/dev_overlay.tscn[/code] and [code]scripts/ui/dev_overlay.gd[/code]
## and the four lines below that use them. That is the entire removal procedure.

## Chapter 4's development lobby: Host, Join, Leave, a roster and a status
## line. Behind its own flag for the same reason as the overlay - it is the one
## piece of Chapter 4 a shipped build must not carry, and it should be removable
## without touching the router or the match scene.
##
## Deleted entirely in Chapter 8, when a real lobby with team select replaces
## it. Nothing in [NetworkManager] depends on it; it depends on
## [NetworkManager], which is the correct direction for a dev tool.

## [b]Chapter 4 set this to false.[/b] Chapters 2 and 3 booted straight into the
## playtest because there was nothing to choose and a Host / Join button led
## nowhere - no second player could appear, so pressing it was strictly worse
## than skipping it. That stopped being true the moment networked spawning
## worked: the main menu's Host and Join are now the real front door, and hiding
## them would have made the chapter's headline feature something you had to know
## to go and find in a corner of the screen.
##
## Set it to true and the menu is bypassed again, which is occasionally useful
## for working on movement or weapon feel without going through two screens.

## overlay plus the placeholder arena, which is correct for every phase until

## phases of the same thing - a match with a player in it - and none of them has
## its own presentation yet, so there is nothing to distinguish between them.
## Once rounds have a real round-start screen, that phase gets its own entry
## here and the rest stay pointed at the playtest.
