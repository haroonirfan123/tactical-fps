extends CanvasLayer
## Development-only readout: the current game state, the scene currently routed
## to, and whether networking is active - plus buttons that force the state
## machine into any legal phase.
##
## [b]This whole file is disposable and is meant to be deleted before release.
## It is deliberately isolated in its own scene and script so removing it does
## not touch the permanent router. To remove it from a build, either set
## [code]Main.DEV_OVERLAY_ENABLED[/code] to false, or delete
## [code]scenes/ui/dev_overlay.tscn[/code], [code]scripts/ui/dev_overlay.gd[/code]
## and the four lines in [code]main.gd[/code] that reference them. Nothing
## outside this script should ever come to depend on it.
##
## It is a [CanvasLayer] rather than a bare [Control] so it can be added
## straight to the router and still draw over the 3D world without the router
## having to own a canvas of its own.

## One line explaining what each phase is for, shown under the phase name.

	GamePhase.Phase.WARMUP: "One-off countdown before the very first round. Only runs once per match.",
	GamePhase.Phase.ROUND_START: "Freeze / buy window. The round counter ticks up here, not when combat starts.",
