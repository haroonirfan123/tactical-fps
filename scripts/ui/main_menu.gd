## Title screen: host a match, join one, or quit.
##
## This is the real screen for [b]MAIN_MENU[/b] and the first of the
## [constant Main.SCREENS] entries. It is intentionally plain - default Godot
## controls, no styling - because presentation is Chapter 8's job and anything
## pretty added now would just be thrown away.
##
## Its only real content is the connection flow, which is the part that has to
## be right: [method NetworkManager.join_game] returns before the connection
## is actually established, so the move into the lobby has to wait for
## [signal NetworkManager.join_succeeded] rather than happening immediately.

## Guards the join-succeeded handler so a late success from an abandoned
## attempt cannot drag us into the lobby.
